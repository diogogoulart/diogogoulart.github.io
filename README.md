#### Summarization
  This folder contains two projects on **text summarization**, showcasing both extractive and abstractive methodologies. The **extractive** summarization project focuses on models like TextRank, LexRank, and LSA to identify and extract the most significant sentences from documents. The **abstractive** summarization project leverages advanced transformer models like T5, Pegasus, and BART to generate concise and coherent summaries by rephrasing and synthesizing information. The scope of these projects includes evaluating model performance through metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore, along with readability assessments.

#### Visualization
  This project provides a Streamlit-based interface for uploading and visualizing multiple data files (CSV or Excel). It supports several chart types—Histogram, Scatter, Line, Bar, Pie, Distribution, Boxplot, and Violin plots—with per-plot configuration options such as custom axes scales (e.g., logarithmic), handling of missing data (via methods like dropping rows, interpolation, or KNN), and outlier filtering. Additionally, the tool offers moving averages, error bars (both global numeric and column-based), and the ability to save/load/delete presets so users can store and restore specific plotting configurations across sessions. By unifying data from multiple files into a single interface, it allows flexible comparisons and consistent transformations, all managed through a user-friendly Streamlit application.
